# Surveillance-Robot-for-Security-Applications

Surveillance is the act of close systematic supervision of a person or group.Surveillance is mainly required in areas such as borders of countries, public places, offices, and industries. It is mainly used for monitoring activities.With an increase in crime rates, there is a need for a smart surveillance system that can work with minimum human intervention.A robot is capable of performing programmed activities thus replacing manual work, producing highly accurate outputs and overcoming the limitations of humans.It can be used in the military sect or for guarding the borders and other surveillance activities.It can replace the security system of housing apartments and offices.The smart surveillance robot can be used for real time monitoring and control system in environmental and industrial application.


#Software Tools Used

Raspberry Pi Module 3 Microcontroller: used as interface between hardware and software.
Pi Camera: attached to the robot via a port on the Pi
Raspberry Pi OS and Open CV Python:
A memory card containing the OS running on the Raspberry Pi is inserted into the Micro SD card slot.
Open-CV python is used to program our surveillance robot.

#Implementation of OSI Model:

The Raspberry Pi has Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and USB boot capabilities.
Port: 8081,5010
A Pi cam is connected to the raspberry pi via the USB port.
The Pi camera is attached to the robot via a camera port on the Pi.
